💧 Water Turbine

A water turbine is a mechanical device that converts the energy of flowing or falling water into mechanical energy, which is then converted into electrical energy using a generator.

🔹 Working Principle:

It works on the principle of conversion of hydraulic energy into mechanical energy.
Water strikes the turbine blades → runner rotates → shaft rotates → generator produces electricity.

🔹 Main Parts:

Runner

Blades/Buckets

Shaft

Casing

Guide vanes

Draft tube

🔹 Types of Water Turbines:

Impulse Turbine – Uses kinetic energy of water
Example: Pelton Wheel

Reaction Turbine – Uses both pressure and kinetic energy
Examples:

Francis Turbine

Kaplan Turbine

🔹 Applications:

Hydroelectric power plants

Dams

Renewable energy generation

🔥 Gas Turbine

A gas turbine is a rotary engine that converts the energy of high-temperature and high-pressure gases into mechanical energy.

🔹 Working Principle:

It works on the Brayton Cycle.
Air is compressed → fuel is added and burned → high-pressure gas expands → turbine rotates → generator produces power.

🔹 Main Parts:

Compressor

Combustion chamber

Turbine

Shaft

🔹 Types of Gas Turbines:

Open cycle gas turbine

Closed cycle gas turbine

🔹 Applications:

Aircraft engines

Power plants

Marine engines

Industrial power generation

🔎 Difference Between Water Turbine and Gas Turbine
Water Turbine	Gas Turbine
Uses water as working fluid	Uses air and fuel gas
Used in hydro power plants	Used in thermal & aircraft engines
Renewable energy source	Requires fuel
Operates at low temperature	Operates at very high temperature
